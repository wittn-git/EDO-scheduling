# PPSN2024-EDO-scheduling

This repository was created for the bachelor thesis of Dominic Wittner with the topic "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization for Machine Scheduling", supervised by Dr. Jakob Bossek (RWTH Chair for AI Methodology).

It now serves as the source code reference and experimental data reference for the paper "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization for Parallel Machine Scheduling" by Dominic Wittner and Jakob Bossek.

## TODO (Revision of paper)

- [X] Add the robustness experiments

- [X] Set table format
- [X] Change proof to: normalized, length optimized
- [X] Add stepwise diversity dependent logging in experiments
- [X] Do preliminary tests for the lambdas of XRAI
- [] Change paper structure in overleaf
- [] Run the experiments
- [] Analyze the results
- [] Check if proof is possible for general metrics <- Missing step
- [] Write the paper
