# PPSN2024-EDO-scheduling

This repository was created for the bachelor thesis of Dominic Wittner with the topic "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization for Machine Scheduling", supervised by Dr. Jakob Bossek (RWTH Chair for AI Methodology).

It now serves as the source code reference and experimental data reference for the paper "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization for Parallel Machine Scheduling" by Dominic Wittner and Jakob Bossek.
